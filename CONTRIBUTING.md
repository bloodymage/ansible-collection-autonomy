Variable naming:
var_name: "This is a variable that it is expected a user will want to be able to change"
__var_name: "This name format is used for variables that are not to be changed by an end user.  For 
            example, either a variable that is only for the collection usage,
            (__autonomy_variables_files), or set by a task 'set_fact'"
