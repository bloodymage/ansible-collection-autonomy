# ==================================================================================================
#
# This doesn't work the way I wanted it to work.  The win_acl module uses powershell rather than
# python.  Still there has got to be a way to set windows acls on samba shares.
#
# It may be using the ansible 'command' module with 'setcifsacl' on a cifs mounted share.
# For example mount:
# "//fs/Users /home/{{ domain }}   cifs    _netdev,credentials=/root/creds.txt     0   0"
#
# setcifsacl -a "ACL:Administrator:ALLOWED/0x0/FULL" "/home/{{ domain }}/"
#
# The problem with that approach is setcifsacl uses '-a' to add a new acl, or '-M' to modify.
# So the first time this is run, we will need to add, subsequent runs, it'll need to modify if
# necessary.
#
# This approach also fails at idempotency.  But at least it'd work...
