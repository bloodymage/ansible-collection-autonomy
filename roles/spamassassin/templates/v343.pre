# This is the right place to customize your installation of SpamAssassin.
#
# See 'perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf' for details of what can be
# tweaked.
#
# This file was installed during the installation of SpamAssassin 4.0.0,
# and contains plugin loading commands for the new plugins added in that
# release.  It will not be overwritten during future SpamAssassin installs,
# so you can modify it to enable some disabled-by-default plugins below,
# if you so wish.
#
# There are now multiple files read to enable plugins in the
# /etc/mail/spamassassin directory; previously only one, "init.pre" was
# read.  Now both "init.pre", "v310.pre", and any other files ending in
# ".pre" will be read.  As future releases are made, new plugins will be
# added to new files, named according to the release they're added in.

# OLEVBMacro - Detects both OLE macros and VB code inside Office documents

# It tries to discern between safe and malicious code but due to the threat
# macros present to security, many places block these type of documents outright.

# For this plugin to work, Archive::Zip and IO::String modules are required.
