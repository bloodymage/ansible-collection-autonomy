# Version compatibility - Welcomelist/Blocklist
# In SpamAssassin 4.0, rules containing "whitelist" or "blacklist" have been
# renamed to contain more racially neutral "welcomelist" and "blocklist"
# terms.  When this compatibility flag is enabled, old rule names from stock
# rules will not hit anymore alongside the new ones.  For more information,
# see: https://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/WelcomelistBlocklist
