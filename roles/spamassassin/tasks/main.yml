# The default Debian spamd.conf provides a warning against having max children greater than 5.
#
# However I have found no other documentation as to why it should not be greater than 5 if the
# circumstances allow for it.  This role, defaults max_children to 5, which also happens to be the
# default value as per "man spamd(8p)".

# TODO: Split this into two tasks.  One for 'spamassassin/spamd' daemon and one for 'spamass-milter'
# daemon.
#
# If spamass-milter is modified, postfix needs to be restarted as well.  If spamassassin/spamd is
# modified, postfix does not need to be restarted.
#
# Is there a way to get the best of both?  Do this as a single task, but correctly restarting the
# appropriate daemons?
