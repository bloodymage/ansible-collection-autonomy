# You can enable this below or with the -e option on the commandline.

# Milestones are configurable now.
# Syntax is pretty easy: MILESTONE=time:description
# Default time is in seconds, but it can be postfixed with "d", "w" or "y"
# for days/weeks/years.
# Keep in mind that the description needs to fit in the window.
